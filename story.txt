We are going to create an Infinitive runner game where we have a kid named Jake as our main player. The cops are
after him as he demolished their van from the gateway. We will be having some obstacles in between and jake has
to cross them successfully withput being caught by the cops. After a certain extent Jake will also come across 
some boosters and powers like- a magnet for collecting all the coins at the same time. A score multiplyer which 
doubles up the score etc.
NPC- Barriers, obstacles, boosters, powers and the trains.
PC- Jake(main character) and the cops
The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible and collect as many coins as possible.
Also after every 1000 points the momentum and speed of the game will increase eventually.
